            Imagine an international gateway where goods and merchandise flow across borders. Where countries lower taxes, reduce red tape, and eliminate roadblocks. Where companies import goods and merchandise directly into a Free Trade Zone without paying duties, fees, and taxes - and then export products duty and tax-free.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The Miami Free Trade Zone connects North America, Europe, and Asia to Latin America and the Caribbean via direct air and sea transportation links, plus rail and expressway. Operated by FTZ World Services LLC, the 47-acre Zone saves companies money and time.
